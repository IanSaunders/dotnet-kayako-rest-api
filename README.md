.Net Rest API for Kayako Fusion 4.

**Originally located at http://kayakoapi.codeplex.com/**


**Project Description**
Kayako API makes it easier for developers wanting to interface with the Kayako Fusion REST API. You'll no longer have to write your own! It's developed in C#.

**Kayako Rest API**

The following is an implementation of the REST API supplied with the Kayako Fusion 4.0 Support software. The implementation of the API is relatively complete, though it is missing a few of the API features. The basic structure is very simple to understand and easily extendible. If you extend the core API functions or create any bug fixes feel free to submit them back to the code base.

**Unsupported**

I should re-iterate that the source code is unsupported and comes as-is. It is not necessarily a finished product but can form the basis for your own projects or give you a head start creating your own library

**Examples and Documentation**

The API is horrendously is easy to use. That said there are a few examples of using the API in the attached TestApplication which covers most of the implemented use cases. The code is also documented. Feel free to contribute documentation and examples if you create them! Please see the documentation page for further examples.

**Please upgrade to the latest Kayako 4 version to avoid bugs and for all the features of this API to work**
